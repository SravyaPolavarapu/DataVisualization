## About
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I have always been a numbers person with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I’m fluent in data analysis, creating dashboards in Tableau, and presenting the data in an appropriate form. I excel in Tableau, R, SQL, ASP.NET, C#, Mathematica and Aspen Custom Modeler.

In my analytical works, one of the projects was to find a statistically sound forecast of the companies Cost and Revenue in relation to its corresponding parameters. Applied mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze enormous amounts of data and prepare reports of their results in Tableau. Integrated R & Tableau and performed statistical forecast for Cost and Revenue in Tableau. Analyzed historical data and looked for trends by key accounts. Performed time series and regression analysis to predict future demand for profits. Coordinated with various teams and gathered data from multiple sources to formulate future forecasts. Generated, maintained and updated forecasting models, including regression, STL, ETS and ARIMA models.

On a personal level, I’m detail-oriented, organized and precise in my work. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience fits with the needs of your company. Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
