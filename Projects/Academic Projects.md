## Project 1: Risk factors of diabetes: Evidence by clinical study using SAS 
		
- 	Pilot study of WBC, monocyte, neutrophils, basophils and lymphocytes biology in insulin sensitive resistant in diabetic subjects. 
- 	Analysis of the data collected from the patients of 3 different groups: Placebo, patients were given 40mg of drug and 80mg of drug using SAS.
- 	Generated statistical analysis files, tables, listings, and graphs for Phase II drug trial studies.
- 	Collaborated with Statisticians, Data Manager, and other SAS programmers to provide ad-hoc and routine analyses and reports with regards to the assigned projects.
- 	Support Data management in data creation/transfers and integrity checks.
- 	Imported external files like Excel files, text files, and Database files into SAS data sets using INFILE, LIBNAME, PROC IMPORT, SAS/Macros, and SAS/Connect, etc.
- 	Used various procedures such as Proc Means, Proc Freq and Proc Univariate to check assumptions and produce initial analyses.
- 	Worked with different clinical trials data like Demographic, Medical History, Vital signs, Adverse Event (AE), and Physical examination.
- 	Created SAS data sets by extracting data from various sources and prepared them for statistical analysis.
- 	Manipulated data sets by using RETAIN, ARRAY, DATA _NULL_, SAS Functions, etc.
- 	Used Sorting and Merging techniques on the raw data sets for value added data preparation, to get the required Reports or Analysis data sets.
- 	Created Summary Reports and Tabular Reports using Proc Report and Proc Tabulate.
- 	Written custom safety and efficacy reports by directing SAS output to RTF and HTML files using SAS/ODS.
- 	Ensured analysis data and programming code meet regulatory and company standards (FDA and ICH regulations) and are consistently structured to permit efficient programming and reporting.
- 	Cross-validated programs with others: compared outputs and proofread the coding.

## Project 2: Rapid diagnostic methods and instrumentation to detect malaria parasites in resource limited areas

- 	We detected malaria positive samples where the parasitism count is above 100 per micro litre of blood and it is consistent with microscopic assay results, the quantitative assays we performed using ESE instrumentation correlates with 50 to 400 parasitism per micro litre after that the saturation of the gold assay attained. 
- 	Which is far better than microscopic assay and less time-consuming process.
- 	However still finer experiments should be done for rapid diagnostics in other malaria species.

## Project 3: Early Detection of Diabetic Foot, Submitted to Texas Instruments India Analog Design 

- 	Diabetic foot ulcers, also known as lesions of the skin on the foot with Diabetes Mellitus. When a diabetic ulcer is formed in the foot the temperature of that part increases more than the surrounding parts. 
- 	Thus, we suggest a device that can detect the temperature rise of that ulcer. 
- 	To use the module, first sensor and the microcontroller units are powered on.
- 	The person’s foot for which temperatures must be found should be kept on the footrest. 
- 	The sensors should be kept manually at the 8 parts of the foot and readings should be noted. 
- 	Repeat the same for another foot.
- 	When infrared light is passed, it is reflected based on the thickness of the foot, infrared light already has some temperature now the body temperature gets added to it and reflects which we get as the output. 
- 	These readings are collected and compared for both the foot.
- 	If temperature difference is more than 2.2˚C then ulcer is present at that area. 
- 	Thus, the ulcers can be detected at an early stage.

## Project 4: Bioinformatics approaches to Pathogen-Host Epitope Mimicry

- 	Check if the known epitopes from human respiratory pathogen-proteins that elicit the host immune response share, to some degree, amino acid sequence with host proteins. 
- 	Also, pro-pose some rules that should be taken into consideration in reverse vaccinology approaches and define strategies that should be followed in vaccine design studies.
- 	Therefore, epitopes without any sequence identity with human proteins might be used as vaccine candidates, and the other way around.
